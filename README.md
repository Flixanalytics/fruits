# **Fruit Classification App üçéüçåü•ë**

## **Overview**

The **Fruit Classification App** is a user-friendly web application that allows users to upload an image of a fruit and classify it into one of the following categories using a pre-trained deep learning model:

### **Available Classes:**
- Apple  
- Banana  
- Avocado  
- Mango  
- Orange  
- Pineapple  
- Watermelon  

The app is built using **Streamlit**, leveraging a TensorFlow/Keras-based deep learning model trained to recognize fruits with high accuracy.
